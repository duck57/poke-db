h1. PoGo Nest Lister

h5. A system for tracking PoGo nest migrations for your city's parks

h3. "Link to example nest post in the Facebook format":https://www.facebook.com/groups/pokemongocolumbus/permalink/610361859376798/

h2. Usage

* All commands should be run from the parent directory (Django root) as
* @nestlist/module.py@ @rotate.py@ prepares your database after a nest
migration.  It inserts permanent nests such as water biomes into the
database for your enjoyment.
* @nest_entry.py@ is the main loop for entering new nest reports.
* @update.py@ generates output for Discord or Facebook.  
More formats can be requested if you make a polite pull request with them.
Use the @-f@ parameter to specify which formatting regimen to use.
* All 3 of these modules take a @-d@ parameter.  
@-d@ specifies the date on which the command is to be run:
inserting a new rotation for @rotate.py@, entering nests as of a specific date for @nest_entry.py@,
or generating output on the specified date in @update.py@

h3. Notes

* Iâ€™ve only tested this on my Mac so far and I have no idea how a Windows Python setup would work.
* FreeBSD testing will probably happen pretty soon.
* Requires @Django@, @sortedcontainers@, @click@, and @python-dateutil@ (I hope I did not forget any dependencies)
