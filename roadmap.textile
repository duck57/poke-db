h1. Future Plans (all modules)

h2. -pokescrape-

This will eventually be replaced with scrapy scripts to create tables for
import from wikis.  Challenges include looping to the next pokémon, filtering
out canonical pokémon, and mega evolutions.

At this point, _it may make more sense to manually scrape and enter the data_.

h2. nestlist

* Add a TUI editor for nests 

h2. pokeperfect

* Actually make it

h2. speciesinfo

* Add pokémon species TUI editor
* Pokémon species Django admin (make it usable)
* All the web stuff here has been done better elsewhere
* TUI type editor
* Search by CP (use db CP functions)
