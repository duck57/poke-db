h1. Future Plans (all modules)

h2. pokescrape

This will eventually be replaced with scrapy scripts to create tables for
import from wikis.  Challenges include looping to the next pokémon, filtering
out canonical pokémon, and mega evolutions.

At this point, it may make more sense to manually scrape and enter the data.

h2. nestlist

* Add a TUI editor for nests 
* Make the web output prettier
* Have separate webpage and copypage views
* Discord bot hooks

h2. pokeperfect

* Include support for non-defualt settings (old CP values, weather boost restrictions, etc…)

h2. speciesinfo

* Add pokémon species TUI editor
* All the web stuff here has been done better elsewhere

h2. typeedit

* TUI type editor
* Probably no web UI
