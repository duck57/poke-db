h1. Pokémon Database 3.0

This is a repo for a database that stores data primarily related to Pokémon Go.

Folder @pokedb@ is a Django project containing several apps:

* @nestlist@ is an app for editing and displaying data for various nest migrations
* @typeedit@ is more of a demonstration-only app for editing the Pokémon types
* @speciesinfo@ contains an editor for editing and adding new Pokémon when they get released
* @pokeperfect@ checks your Pokémon's CP to calculate whether it is 100% or 0% IVs

Folder @pokescrape@ contains spcapy scrapers for wikis of Pokémon fangames to gather the
data from custom species to add to the database.

Folder @stats_source@ has various data files that went into the data of the database.
Some organized seed data and SQL setup scripts may eventually go there as well.
